Is there a maximum TheoriaMetron

```py

BetaTheoriaMetron = (MoveTheoriaMetron + EkoTheoriaMetron + ViaTheoriaMetron + PsykheTheoriaMetron)

```

## MoveTheoriaMetron

## EkoTheoriaMetron

## ViaTheoriaMetron

## PsykheTheoriaMetron

How much do you need know how to do?, How much power is required?,

Dyno = Metron(2, 5, )

Beta Teknik describes the total difficulty of a Climber's performance.

Psike is not scored in a BetaComp since it is difficult to observe directly and can be observed indirectly in the Move and <via>Route</via> of a Climber's performance. The only place where Psike could be observed in a Climber is their emotional facial expressions, but Climbers are almost always facing the wall, so their face can't be seen.  

technic (adj.)
1610s, "technical, pertaining to an art," from Latin technicus, from Greek tekhnikos "of or pertaining to art, experienced in art, made by art," from tekhnÄ“ "art, skill, craft" (see techno-).
